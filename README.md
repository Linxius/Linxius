I am a PhD candidate of Computer Science at College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University. My supervisor is Prof. Hui Huang. My research interest lies in computer grahics, especially in point cloud, urban scene perception and reconstruction. I currently a reviewer of  IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). [[Personal Homepage]](https://linxius.github.io/)
